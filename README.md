Final Project for DS340W at Penn State

- Parent Paper One: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7882057/
- Research Paper Two: https://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=148913
- Research Paper Three: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8645264/

We plan to use the code and database attributed to Parent Paper 1, as this is more in line with our research interests. We include the code and data for Research Paper 2 as well, as this gives us insight to techniques and avenues for future work with Parent Paper 1.
